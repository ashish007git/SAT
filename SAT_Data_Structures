For variables assignments data structure,
Array of n variables,
-1 : Unassigned
0, 1: Assigned 0 or 1

Sort all the literals (numerically with sign) for each of the clauses separately and split into two lists.
One maintaining all the complemented literals (-ve numbers) and other maintaining uncomplemented literals (+ve numbers).

Stack to maintain only the free decisions that we have made so far. Upon backtracking, pop the appropriate elements from the top of the stack.
