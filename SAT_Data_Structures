For variables assignments data structure,
Array of n variables,
-1 : Unassigned
0, 1: Assigned 0 or 1

Sort all the literals (numerically with sign) for each of the clauses separately and split into two lists.
One maintaining all the complemented literals (-ve numbers) and other maintaining uncomplemented literals (+ve numbers).

Stack to maintain only the free decisions that we have made so far. Upon backtracking, pop the appropriate elements from the top of the stack.

if(parent == null) free decision.
else forced decision.

store free decisions in adjacency list??

decide variable to branch on based on max clauses containing x or x'.

Resolution of unit clauses which have binate variable is a CONFLICT.

All forced decisions will be because of 2-SAT.

All forced decisions not involved in conflict literal, and thus can  be retained even after backtracking.
They are anyway satisfying some of the clauses.

Can we incorporate huffman encoding for the variables? Not good idea.
